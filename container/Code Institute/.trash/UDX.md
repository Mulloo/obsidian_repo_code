## Strategy Plane.
	User needs, Business goals.
		What problem is this product intended to solve? This layer, the most abstract of the model, takes into consideration both user needs and business goals.
## Scope Plane.
	Functional and content requirements.
		What is the product that will be created to solve the problem? Within this layer, the team defines functional requirements (what features to build) and content requirements (written and visual information to include).
## Structure Plane.
	Information architecture, interaction design.
		How is the design organized and how do interactions work? This layer includes information architecture (the structure and organization of content) and interaction design (the interactive experience of the product).
## Skeleton Plane.
	Interface design, navigation design, information design.
	How is information presented and arranged? This layer begins to consider UI design (design of interface elements), navigation design (how users move through a system), and information design (presenting information to facilitate understanding). A common output at this stage is a set ofÂ [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe).
## Surface Plane.
	Visual Design.
	How does the product look and feel to users? This stage emphasizes visual design, for example, what colors and typefaces are used, and is the stage where UI design is front and center (though it is not exclusive to the surface).
