## Deployment

To publish the website, I utilized GitHub Pages as the hosting platform. Here's a breakdown of the deployment process:

- Navigate to the GitHub repository and access the "Settings" tab.

- In the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "Source" section. Locate the drop-down menu and opt for the "Master Branch" from the available options.

- Following the selection of the master branch, GitHub Pages will refresh the page automatically. Keep an eye out for a ribbon display, providing a detailed confirmation of a successful deployment.

For live site access, follow this [link](https://mulloo.github.io/Titanfall-2-Weapon-Wiki/)

This deployment method ensures that the most recent version of your project on the master branch is accessible via the live link. It offers a straightforward means to share and present your project online using GitHub Pages.
