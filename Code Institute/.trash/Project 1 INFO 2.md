    </h1>
    <h2>
        HTML/CSS Essentials
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful
        information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so
        far.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is presented to help users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a
        product/service in which they are interested. The presentation of this data
        advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Main Technologies
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Required: HTML, CSS
    </h4>

    <h3>
        Project Ideas
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can either choose to build the website based on Project Idea 0, or take
        inspiration from the other example ideas below.

    <h3>
        Project Idea 0
    </h3>

    <p>
        Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a
        specific real or imagined need. Use the relevant project assessment criteria as
        a guide to the minimum required functionality

        <strong>N.B. </strong>When choosing a portfolio project, it is best practice to
        choose a new topic. The reason for this is to avoid duplicating your HTML/CSS
        code as it can only be graded once. If you resubmit part of a previous project,
        you cannot receive marks for this. For this reason, we strongly recommend that
        you create 5 different projects using the ideas provided. Furthermore, you want
        to display a diverse portfolio to prospective employers.<br><br>In a small number of
        cases, if your reason for completing the course is to develop a business idea,
        you may want to create a single project. This approach is
        not recommended. Please do not proceed in this way before discussing your
        intention with Student Care. It will need to be approved in advance of your
        submission.

    <h1>Merit Performance</h1>

    <p>
        It is expected that the learning clearly demonstrates characteristics of
        higher-level performance as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        To evidence performance at the Merit level, a learner will, in general,
        demonstrate characteristics of performance at the Merit level as outlined below.
        The learner must achieve all Merit criteria for a merit to be awarded.<br><br>The learner has a clear rationale
        for the
        development of this project and has produced a fully functioning,
        well-documented website for a real-life audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing a particular
        target audience (or multiple related audiences). Its purpose would be
        immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting
        documentation. The website’s design follows the principles of UX design and
        accessibility guidelines, and the site is fully responsive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code is well-organised and easy to follow, and the application has been fully
        tested, following a planned, manual testing procedure, with no obvious errors
        left in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The development process is evident through commit messages. The project’s
        documentation provides a clear rationale for the development of this project and
        covers all stages of the development life cycle.

    <h1>Distinction Performance</h1>
    <p>
        At this level, a learner will have <span class="header-red-small">achieved all pass and merit criteria</span>,
        as
        described above, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance
        as described below:<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world
        application and a comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an
        evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current
        practice. There are no obvious errors in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted
        good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate,
        and acceptable to the target user. It clearly matches the design and
        demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code.
        The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough
        projects encountered in the course.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Amplification (craftsmanship):</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Design</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX
        design:
    </p>
    <p>
        Information Hierarchy
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on
            the site is presented in an organised fashion, with each piece of information
            being easy to find
        </li><li>all resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the
            layout of the site intuitively
        </li><li>information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        User Control
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive
            emotional response within the user. This is down to the flow of information
            layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all
            interaction feedback
        </li><li>when displaying media files, the site avoids autoplay of audio; instead, let
            the user initiate and control such actions
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Consistency
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as
            design<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Confirmation

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>user actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Accessibility
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>there is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all
            pages/sections and in all interactivity
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience
        design principles are <strong>identified and described </strong>(comments in
        code and/or a section in the README)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Development and Implementation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Code demonstrates the characteristics of ‘clean code’<strong>:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming,
        e.g.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>file names and class names are descriptive and consistent
        </li><li>for cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have
            spaces in them and will be lower-case only
        </li><li>all HTML attributes and CSS rules are consistent in format, follow standards
            for the language and are appropriate and meaningful
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        File structure
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an
            assets directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into
            sub-directories such as CSS, etc.)
        </li><li>there is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for
            example, library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries')
        </li><li>files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or
            capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Readability
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability, and there are
            no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2)
        </li><li>id/class/attribute names clearly indicate their purpose
        </li><li>CSS code is split into well-defined and commented sections
        </li><li>Semantic markup is used to structure HTML code
        </li><li>HTML and CSS are kept in separate, linked files
        </li><li>CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Comments
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>all custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the
            purpose of code segments
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Compliant code
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
        </li><li>CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Robust code
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>no logic errors are found when running code
        </li><li>errors caused by user actions are handled
        </li><li>inputs are validated when necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The full design is implemented, providing <strong>a good solution to the users'
            demands and expectations</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Real-world application</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum
            placeholder text
        </li><li>All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
        </li><li>Any custom video content is fit for purpose
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Version control systems are used effectively:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>all code is managed in git with commit messages that reflect the specific
            reason for the commit
        </li><li>there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix
        </li><li>there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the
            development process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The solution’s purpose is documented:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose of the application is clearly described in the README - key
            project goals, target audience, screenshots
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="readme">README</h1>
    <p>
        Recommended structure for a README.md file:
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>As a mandatory part of the submission, your project must have a
        readme file named README.md, in markdown format, that will describe all aspects
        of your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The link below provides an official example of an expected structure for your
        readme file
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template" target="_blank">Example
            README.md template</a><br><br>NOTE:
    </p>
    <p>
        While it is a requirement for your README to be in English, we also strongly
        recommend that your site is in English too. The assessment will be conducted in
        English so to ensure that the functionality and navigation can be fully
        assessed, we recommend that the site is in English. If the site is in a language
        other than English, at a very minimum you should ensure you have correctly set
        the <code>lang </code>attribute in the HTML to the character code of the web
        apps content language. This will allow the browser to attempt a translation into
        English.
    </p>
    <h1 id="plagiarism">
        Plagiarism
    </h1>
    <p>
        <br>Plagiarism, as defined by the Oxford dictionary is “<em>the practice
            of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.</em>”
        It is a serious academic offence for which there are serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is acceptable to use and reference others’ code however it is an academic
        plagiarism offence if any piece of work which is not entirely the student’s own
        is not correctly referenced or acknowledged. All student projects submitted
        will be reviewed for plagiarism. This includes checking code comparison tools,
        plagiarism software, review of git commit history and other mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the responsibility of each student to ensure that any direct or indirect
        inclusion of the work of others is fully and adequately acknowledged. We
        appreciate that plagiarism may be unintentional however it will still be treated
        as an offence. The Tutoring team can answer any plagiarism related queries, but
        as a general rule, if in doubt, include attribution of all sources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students are encouraged to ask mentors, tutors and their peers for advice about
        their project work but any submission should not include any code written by
        others, unless it is explicitly credited to them. Failure to correctly credit
        code that a student hasn’t created themselves will be considered plagiarism and
        will result in a failing grade. Blatant or repeat offences of plagiarism will
        not be tolerated and will result in stringent penalties being applied, including
        removal from the course.
    </p>

    <h1 id="assessment-policy">
        Assessment Policy<br>
    </h1>
    <p>
        The programme is assessed by 5 milestone projects. Some modules have challenges
        for you to complete however these are not graded. All 5 projects must be
        separate submissions, meeting the specified project brief requirements. All 5
        projects must be passed before the Diploma can be awarded.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your project is due at 12.00 noon (Irish time) on the specified submission date.
        Please contact Student Care if you are unclear what your submission date
        is.<br><br>Any project not submitted on time will be considered a
        fail. The project will be accepted up to 10 days after the original submission
        date, subject to payment of a late submission fee of €150. The grade will also
        be capped at the pass mark. Code Institute reserves the right not to accept any
        projects submitted after 10 days. Repeated late submissions will not be
        tolerated.<br><br><strong>Extenuating circumstances </strong>are
        unforeseen significant events which may affect your ability to complete the
        course/submit your projects on time. Such circumstances include serious illness,
        hospitalisation, immediate family bereavement etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Supporting documentation for such circumstances must be provided for the
        extenuating circumstance to be considered. Foreseen events such as holidays,
        work commitments, weddings etc. are not considered extenuating.​<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you find yourself in this situation, please contact Student Care as soon as
        is practical to discuss it. These instances are treated on a case by case
        basis. Supporting documentation e.g. medical certificate will be required for
        any additional time to be granted.</p>
    <h4>Please note, it will be assumed that
        you are proceeding with your studies as intended, until you advise us
        otherwise</h4>.

    <h1 id="completion">Completing your portfolio project</h1>
    <p>Your work on the portfolio project for this module is ready for submission once you've completed the following
        steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have completed all of the functional requirements for the project work</li>
        <li>You have deployed the project and documented the deployment</li>
        <li>You have tested the project extensively and documented your testing</li>
        <li>You have written sufficient overall documentation in the README.md file in English</li>
        <!-- <li>You have correctly set the <code>lang</code> attribute in the html to the web apps content language</li> -->
        <li>You have had your final project review session with your mentor and addressed their feedback if any</li>
        <li>You have checked you have met all assessment criteria for the learning outcomes </li>
        <li>You are overall happy with your work</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="notification">Grade Notification</h1>
    <p>Results are sent by email. The typical timeframe for receiving these from the date of submission are
    </p><ul>
        <li><strong>Project 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Up to 4 weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Project 3 &amp; 4:</strong> Up to 6 weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Project 5:</strong> Up to 8 weeks. This result will be sent with your overall grade for the course.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> In the unlikely event that you have not received your results within the above timeframes, please contact
        Student Care.</p>
    <h1 id="resubmissions">
        Resubmissions
    </h1>
    <p>
        If a project submission does not meet the required standard, you may resubmit
        your project to achieve a pass. Student Care will liaise with you to arrange the
        timeframe for a resubmission.
    </p>
    <p>
        The grade for any project resubmitted will be capped at the pass mark. You will
        not be informed of the actual result. The maximum number of resubmissions per
        project is two. The resubmission fee is €50. A student whose project has
        received a pass mark is not permitted to resubmit their project with a view to
        achieving a higher grade.
    </p>
    <h1 id="appeals">
        Appeals
    </h1>
    <p>
        Where a student feels they have been unfairly marked or that the marking is
        inconsistent with the assessment criteria, they may appeal their grade. The
        appeal must be requested in writing to Student Care within 2 weeks of the grade
        being released. In doing so, you must also outline the grounds on which you are
        appealing the awarded grade. The project in its previously submitted format will
        be graded by a different assessor. You may not make any changes to your project
        (source code or live version) while the appeal process is taking place. The
        result of the appeal, which may be higher or lower than the original grade will
        be the final grade awarded. There is a €50 fee for the appeal which will be
        refunded if the outcome of the appeal is a higher passing grade. The appeal
        process will be completed within 5 weeks.
    </p>
    <h1 id="final-grade">Final Grade Calculation</h1>
    <p>The five projects all contribute to your final grade. This is calculated
        from the points awarded for a pass/merit/distinction
        multiplied by the number of credit points per module.
        The full details of the calculation can be found in the
